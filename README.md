# Travel Easily - Share Your Journey

## About the Project

Travel Easily is a platform designed to help travelers plan multi-day trips easily and quickly. Instead of wasting time searching through excessive information on Google or suitable groups on Facebook, users can access posts from other travelers detailing their experiences day by day. Users can comment on posts, like them, and share their own travel stories.

## Technologies

The site is built using React and TypeScript, with custom CSS design without relying on external libraries. All functionalities of the site operate in real-time, including the rendering of comments and updating of like statuses.

## Features

- **Registration and Login**: Users can create an account, log in, and stay logged in until they log out.
- **User Profile**: Each user can upload a profile picture and update it.
- **Sharing Trips**: Users can share new trips by selecting parameters such as the type of trip, the country, the number of days, and entering a description for each day.
- **Search for Trips**: Users can search for trips that have already been shared by others.
